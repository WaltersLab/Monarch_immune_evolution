# Population Genomic Analysis of Immune Genes in Monarch Butterflies

This repo contains a record of scripts and results involved in a popgen analysis of immunge genes in monarch butterflies, _Danaus plexippus_.

The first iteration of this work was described in a biorxiv submission: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/620013v1.full

The code/results for that initial analysis is in the folder `biorxiv_version1`. This includes the sets of "control" genes selected for each "immune" gene which was also employed in the revised analysis. These files are found in directory: 
`Paired-control_analyses/2_Select_controls_and_run_permutations/Outputs/Selected_control_gene_lists`


Revised analyses for the current version of the manuscript are in `monarch_immune_revision_analysis`. It is worth noting that pop gene parameter estimates in the revised version are based on scripts and workflow developed by Venkat Talla for a [demographic analysis of monarchs](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.15508). Scripts immediately relevant to the immune gene analysis are included here (see `Talla_immune_gene_analysis`), but for further details please see https://github.com/venta380/Monarch_genomics
